Recipe Application 

Project Description


The following features are included in the Recipe App project that I developed:

* The user may input information about a single recipe. 

* The recipe contains the number of ingredients, the number of steps, and the description of each step. 

* After entering the information, the user can view the entire recipe.

* The user may ask for quantities to be returned to their initial settings. 

* The user can ask to have all data cleared. 

* The user has the option to ask for a factored scaling of the quantities.

* Entering a String in lieu of an integer will cause the program to crash and generate an error. 


3. Choosing option 2 will cause the full recipe, including the information the user submitted, to be displayed. 

* The user will be returned to the menu after the recipe has been presented. 


4. Choosing option 3 will present the user with a menu where they may choose which factor to scale by; the variables that are available are (0.5,2,3)
 
* The ingredient quantity will decrease by 0.5 if factor 0.5 is chosen;
 
* The ingredient quantity will increase by 2 if factor 2 is chosen;
 
* The ingredient quantity will increase by 3 if factor 3 is chosen.

* The menu will reappear to provide the user with additional options after they have finished scaling their recipe.

5. Choosing option 4 will return the function to its initial value by allowing you to reset the Scaled Ingredient Quantity.

* Once option 4 has been completed, a menu will appear for the user to access once again.


6. Choosing option 5 will delete all of the user-entered details and prevent any data from being displayed. 
* A menu will reappear if the user wishes to enter details later.
